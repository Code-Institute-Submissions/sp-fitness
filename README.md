# SP Fitness

This website is to advertise the services of a personal trainer, demonstrating his skills and experience, along with short testimonials from former clients.
The aim of the website is to entice potential future customers to get in contact, and arrange a consultation with the trainer, using the contact section of the page.

##UX

This website is for people interested in improving their heath and fitness by the way of exercise and dieting.
The simple, structured layout is designed to be easily navigateable, so that anyone can easily find information relevant to their goals, and are encouraged to get in contact if they wished to take things further.

For example, an athlete in their mid 20's is looking to get assistance with their nutrition, in preparation for a sporting event, they access the website, and see diet plans advertised throughout the home page.
As a result they read a little about the types of plan the trainer offers, and then see the option to make contact if they want to know more.

Another example is a person looking to start going to the gym for the first time. They easily view that workout plans are a core part of what the trainer offers, and can then make contact with the trainer to start planning it.

## Testing
I have run through all links on all pages, ensuring they all connect as intended.
The contact form has been tested, to verify that it cannnot proceed without the name, a valid email address is input, and a success message appears when submitting the request.
Validating that all text is readable regardless of screen-size, and that images and other media are correctly re-positioned in a pre-planned way when the screen size changes.
